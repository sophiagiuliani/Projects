        The Funnel analysis is very useful to check in which step of the website the customer leaves. It helps to understand the customer 
behavior, that leads to the identification of possible problems. In this project I analyzed the customer behavior in three different countries,
and also the customer behavior depending their mobile brand.

      The results can be visualized in Google Sheets, using the link above.
